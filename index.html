	<h1>Different Types of Fried Chicken</h1>
	<strong><h3><li> Standard fried chicken</li></h3></strong>
	<ul><p>It's good, but its basic. Nothing extra added unless it's a special occassion.</p></ul>
	<p>Personally would love the new standard to add a flavor of spice</p>
	
	<h3><li>Kentucky Fried Chicken</li></h3>
	<ul><p> Taste well. Though for my own personal taste its a tad bit more salty.</p></ul>
	<p> Would honestly like if they had a more spicy version of their chicken rather then the original.</p>
	<p> Which they do have a more spicy version but it doesnt taste as spicy as it should.</p>
